    However, a lot of us have been experiencing a lack of sleep for various reasons, such as stress, 
    or we just have busy and chaotic lives with school and work.
    It made us curious about the biggest reasons of lack of sleep and how the amount of sleep affects us. 
    In our project Sleep Well, we asked questions such as what is causing people to have a lack of sleep, 
    what is the average amount of sleep that lets people feeling well rested, and how does sleep affect stress levels.
    The stakeholders are people who experience insomnia, do not get enough sleep, have trouble sleeping, 
    and people who experience high levels of stress because of poor sleep. 
    This will benefit them because it can help them find out if thereâ€™s anything wrong with their sleep schedule, 
    and their stress levels could be reduced after fixing their sleep. The data we analyzed is from Kaggle. 
    Two of the datasets are data from an iOS app called Sleep Cycle. We used all the data to produce graphs and interactive charts shown below."),
